On Windows, the settings.json and keybindings.json files for Visual Studio Code are stored in your user directory. Here are their full paths:


settings.json
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json

keybindings.json
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\keybindings.json




My current keyboard has on board memory for rebindings for specific keys for example:
- Caps lock key is binded to F8 becuase that is used to switch modes in the vscode vim extension.
- 


For keyboards that don't have rebindings and/or on board memory for windows you can use this method to make my setup usable.
Use the program microsoft powertoys to unbind and the caps lock key to the Esc key to make the vim experience less painful:

Remap Caps Lock to Escape in PowerToys (for VSCode)

    - Install Microsoft PowerToys (if you havenâ€™t already), you can get it from the microsoft store which is the easiest. Then open it and navigate to the Keyboard Manager section.
    - Select Remap a key to add a new key mapping.
    - Click the + icon to create a new remapping.
    - For Key (on the left), choose Caps Lock.
    - For Mapped To (on the right), choose Escape.
    - Click OK to save this mapping.
    - (Optional) If you only want this remapping to apply when VSCode is active, go to Remap shortcuts instead and specify VSCode as the targeted application.

VIM Keybinds to remember:
- ctrl + y
    - moves the code editor window view up one line without adjusting the cursor
- ctrl + e
    - moves the code editor window view down one line without adjusting the cursor
