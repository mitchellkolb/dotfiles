On Linux, the settings.json and keybindings.json files for Visual Studio Code are stored in your user directory. Here are their full paths:


settings.json
/home/HOSTNAME/.config/Code/User/settings.json

keybindings.json
/home/HOSTNAME/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json



My current keyboard has on board memory for rebindings for specific keys for example:
- Caps lock key is binded to F8 becuase that is used to switch modes in the vscode vim extension.
-
